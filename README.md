# Pharaoh
---
## Description 

### Pharaoh is a 2D platformer that was I developed over summer 2023.  It takes everything that I learned in my first year of college and applies it for me to not only keep the knowledge fresh but also create a foundation for me to build new and better solutions off of.  This game was developed in attempt to make all levels entirely data driven. What this means for Pharaoh is the ability to make new levels can actually be done by anybody without programming! Each level consists of a folder that has all relevant data to the levels creation. I started the game out with 5 levels but after that the number of levels is entirely up to the player!
